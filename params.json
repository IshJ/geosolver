{"name":"GeoS","tagline":"end-to-end geometry problem solver","body":"### About\r\nGeoS is an end-to-end system that solves high school geometry questions. That is, its input is question text in natural language and diagram in raster graphics, and its output is the answer to the question. \r\n\r\n### Data\r\n- [GeoServer](https://github.com/seominjoon/GeoServer)\r\n\r\n### Demos\r\n- [G-Aligner](http://trusty.cs.washington.edu:9239/vpsel/)\r\n\r\n### Papers\r\n- [Solving geometry problems: combining text and diagram interpretation](http://seominjoon.github.io/geosolver/images/emnlp2015.pdf)..\r\n..Minjoon Seo, Hannaneh Hajishirzi, Ali Farhadi, Oren Etzioni, and Clint Malcolm..\r\n..In proceedings of EMNLP 2015.\r\n- [Diagram understanding in geometry questions](http://seominjoon.github.io/geosolver/images/aaai2014.pdf)..\r\n..Minjoon Seo, Hannaneh Hajishirzi, Ali Farhadi, and Oren Etzioni..\r\n..In proceedings of AAAI 2014.\r\n\r\n### Acknowledgements\r\nThe research was supported by the Allen Institute for AI, Allen Distinguished Investigator Award, and NSF (IIS-1352249).
